##Miscellanea

- The layout can be ignored by putting **layout false** into the controller.
- Any instance variables we define in a method of a controller become available for use in the views.

##Hosting

- [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) seems to be the easiest solution that allows me to focus more on development, and less on setting up a server.
