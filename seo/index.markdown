It really annoys me how often the acronym <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> is misused. There are very few true SEO experts out there (and I am certainly not one of them) and too many companies promise to deliver SEO-friendly websites when they have not idea what it actually means.

That being said, it must be understood that by consistentlty following some well established principles, everyone can build up a pretty decent SEO ranking. It always takes **time**, though. SEO is about trust - search engines must believe that your site is relevant and enjoyable to its user. Just like in human relationships building up trust takes **time and continuous effort**.

No company can take care of your SEO without you being an active part of the process. Why? Because you are they only person who really knows what your site is about.

## Non-Exhaustive List of SEO Principles

- Add a meaningful \<title> element to each page of your site. Some suggest to stay below 60 words.
- Use HTML5's semantic elements such as \<article>, \<section>, \<aside>,...to organize your <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>.
