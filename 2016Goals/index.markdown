##SMART Goals

<p>Last update: {{ page.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</p>

The SMART acronym stands for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-boud. Without goals a person wanders aimlessly through their life. I have already defined my [professional goals](http://shankxwebdev.com/my-professional-goals-for-2016/) but it is just as important to think about personal goals.

Here is a quick summary for those who don't want to read the whole page.

- Educate myself on measuring the ROI of rentals.
- Adjust finances to being self-employed.
- Lose weight.
- Develop a more defined and distinct clothing style.

As a professional developer I want to invest my assets so that they ***create passive income and wealth***. I am heavily interested in getting into the rental real estate. I already own a house in Oxford, Ohio that I am renting out. However, I need to get a better grasp of the numbers related to that investment. I will use that house to educate myself on measuring the ROI of a rental. In 2016, I will ***expose all the numbers*** here on this website. ***By the end of each week I shall update this page with new insights.***

I bought a course on real estate investing. In 2016, I will work through the course and ***publish great insights here***. The course itself contains many actionable tasks that I will write about and report on here.

Since I have immigrated to the US I haven't really ***adjusted my finances*** to being an independent business owner. This needs to ***change in 2016***. Again, I will publish my findings and steps I take here.

In 2016, I ***will lose weight*** which will require more exercise and a healthy diet. More details and numbers coming soon.

In 2016, I will develop a more defined and distinct ***clothing style***.
