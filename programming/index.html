<p>Being a good programmer requires thorough understanding of at least one programming language and multiple programming concepts. I have no intention to provide a complete reference. This is much more a living research document that I use to keep track of my own learning.</p>

<p><i>Important!</i> I believe that it is essential to break big problems into small digestible chunks of knowledge that make sense to a novice. I intentionally <strong>simplify concepts</strong> for my own sake. Once you understand basics, you can go off on your own to explore a topic in greater depth. I am a huge fan of creating <strong>simplified models</strong>.</p>
