<h1 id="rules">Understanding the rules of the game(s)</h1>

One major <strong>problem</strong> that <strong>perfectionists</strong> often run into is that they apply their perfectionism to every situation in life. Whether it's school, work, or volunteering - they feel like they always have to deliver 150%. If you are like that, I have an important message for you. You have to learn <strong>judging</strong> which situation requires what level of perfectionism! Spend time <strong>understanding the rules of the game</strong> and try to meet these expectations. More often than not, getting the job done is all that counts, and nobody's interested in how you got there - they care about actually getting there.

I promise that if you are a perfectionist, and you learn to <strong>adjust your level of perfectionism</strong> to the needs and reality of the situation you are dealing with, a whole new world of opportunities will open up to you. Give it a try!

Michael Locke is a very <strong>inspiring</strong> UI/UX designer who puts a lot of effort towards helping other people. He has a pretty awesome and affordable web design training on <a href="http://www.mlwebco.com/" target="_blank">www.mlwebco.com</a> which I can only recommend. He recorded a video in which he speaks about perfectionism. He talks about the importance of <strong>just putting your work out there</strong>, without being afraid that it may not be good enough. That is knowing the rules of the game. Michael learned that you can get great job offers and projects by showing what you know.

<h1 id="measuring">Choosing your measuring stick</h1>

I get it like no one else - trust me. You <strong>want to be perfect</strong> and you <strong>compare yourself</strong> to people you admire. You most likely have a mentor, a colleague, or a technical author you highly respect.

If you are like me, you tend to compare yourself to these people, and you end up being <strong>somewhat frustrated</strong> when you realize that your role models are far ahead of you. What you forget is that you are comparing yourself to people who probably have a bunch of years <strong>more experience</strong> than you. How <strong>fair</strong> are you to yourself? Would you expect a high school student to be better at mathematics than a PhD student? Probably not. So <strong>give yourself a break</strong> and <strong>accept who you are</strong>. Keeping working diligently and <strong>you will get where you need to be</strong>.

<h1 id="embrace">Embrace who you are</h1>

Why do perfectionists often feel like having to tame their perfectionism? After all, they likes perfection, so why would they want to fight it? Living beings tend to dislike pain, whatever pain may mean to them. <strong>Feeling stupid</strong> is a pain that many perfectionists <strong>fear</strong> precisely because they love perfection. Thus, they frequently become a <strong>hindrance to themselves</strong> when confronted with their own (relative) imperfection. There are two simple steps that help breaking out of the vicious circle:

<ol>
<li>Accept that <strong>you are infinitely unknowledgeable</strong>. Knowledge knows no boundaries, hence you will always remain pretty vacuous.</li>

<li><strong>Stop caring</strong> about what <strong>you think</strong> about yourself. Picture another dimension of yourself, and just let that being do its thing. As long as it is happy, whatâ€™s the harm?</li>
<li><strong>Stop caring</strong> about what <strong>other people</strong> think since most will never get you....and they don't need to either.</li></ol>

You may want to swap the term <i>perfectionist</i> with the word <i>geek</i>, if you consider yourself to be one.
