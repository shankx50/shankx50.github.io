<h1><a href="#rules">Understanding the Rules of the Game</a></h1>

One major <strong>problem</strong> that <strong>perfectionists</strong> often run into is that they apply their perfectionism to every situation in life. Whether it's school, work, or volunteering - they feel like they always have to deliver 150%. If you are like that, I have an important message for you. You have to learn <strong>judging</strong> which situation requires what level of perfectionism! Spend time <strong>understanding the rules of the game</strong> and try to meet these expectations. More often than not, getting the job done is all that counts, and nobody's interested in how you got there - they care about actually getting there.

I promise that if you are a perfectionist, and you learn to <strong>adjust your level of perfectionism</strong> to the needs and reality of the situation you are dealing with, a whole new world of opportunities will open up to you. Give it a try!

I get it like no one else - trust me. You <strong>want to be perfect</strong> and you <strong>compare yourself</strong> to people you admire. You most likely have a mentor, a colleague, or a technical author you highly respect.

If you are like me, you tend to compare yourself to these people, and you end up being <strong>somewhat frustrated</strong> when you realize that your role models are far ahead of you. What you forget is that you are comparing yourself to people who probably have a bunch of years <strong>more experience</strong> than you. How <strong>fair</strong> are you to yourself? Would you expect a high school student to be better at mathematics than a PhD student? Probably not. So <strong>give yourself a break</strong> and <strong>accept who you are</strong>. Keeping working diligently and <strong>you will get where you need to be</strong>.
