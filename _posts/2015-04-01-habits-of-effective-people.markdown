	<h1><li>Getting enough sleep!</li></h1>
	<p>Who doesn't know all nighters? Precious nocturnal hours are misused to meet a project's deadline, thinking that there is no other way to drive remaining tasks to completion. <strong>Sleep is important!</strong> If you sleep for at least 5-7 hours per night, you can work faster and more effective because your mind is sharp and clear.</p>
