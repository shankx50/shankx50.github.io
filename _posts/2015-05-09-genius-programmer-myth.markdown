##Stay Hungry - Stay Foolish

As a perfectionist, an extremely driven and ambitious programmer the topic I am about to discuss is of paramount importance. I often wonder how much time I waste thinking about how good I want to be, how good I am, and what I have to do to reach my goals. Human beings don't like to feel stupid. The problem with being a programmer is that you need to get used to that feeling. Being stupid, not knowing and finding out is what defines a programmer. It also is part of what makes programming so interesting. **You can never know it all**. In Steve Jobs' words at the *2005 Stanford Commmencement Address* : **<q>Stay hungry - Stay foolish</q>**.

##Embrace Failure

We need to learn that **failure is good**. We learn by failing. Programming techniques and tools (e.g. version control) lend themselves to pretending that every programmer out there is almost perfect. That is understandable since most coders have a tendency to only publish finalized code. But let me ask you - how much time to you think that other programmers spend debugging and problem-solving? They all do! Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that seasoned programmers don't work faster as novices, because they do. The point is that **they all struggle, and they all fail over and over again**. But again, don't take it from me - take it from people who should know.

Let's shift our mindsets and let's **consider failure a part of growing**. Let's embrace failure - let's seek failure. **We shall never give up, always try again, because we live our passion!**
