Since I have started programming I have heard coders talk about the differences between object-oriented-programming (OOP) and functional programming.

## What is object-oriented-programming?

According to the book _Scala in action_ by Nilanjan Raychaudhuri, a pure object-oriented language should have the following characteristics:

* Encapsulation/infromation hiding
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism/dynamic binding
* All predefined types are objects
* All operations are performed by sending messages to objects
* All user-defined types are objects

OOP helps the programmer to structure his/her code and its underlying concepts. Once OOP is understood, many problems can be solved by modeling problems after real world objects.

An object has **states** and **behavior** where its states are attributes and behavior is described by methods/functions linked to that object.

## What is functional programming?
