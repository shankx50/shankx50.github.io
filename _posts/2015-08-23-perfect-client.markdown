![Top Five Qualities I Seek In My Clients](/assets/perfect_client.png)

It is extremely important to create an environment allowing you to work with people you appreciate - that includes your clients. Not only will you feel more energized, you will also become an exclusive resource because you choose to not work with anyone who is willing to write you a check. Learn to say no to people you don't like to work with.

Describing the perfect client starts with describing features in people that turn you off.

###What turns me off:

- Hagglers:

People who don't understand that fair money means transforming and transferring positive life energy. They are not respecting your expertise and your time. They are not respecting you! It's interesting to note that the more someone pays you, the easier they are to work with. How often have you tried doing someone a favor by charging less, and then they turn out to be a high-maintenance and obnoxious client?

- People who are not organized:

If you don't know where you are heading to, then you can't be organized. Tell people to make up their mind, and come back when they are ready.

- People who want everything as fast as possible:

Reasonable deadlines are ok. Deadlines that challenge you are ok, too. But someone who expects everyone ASAP doesn't understand that quality matters. I am not saying take forever, I am saying take the time it needs to make it right.

- arrogance, greed, stupidity and jealousy

- People who use condescending language when talking about others.

- narrow-mindedness

- People without goals.

- People who don't respect my privacy, nor time.

###So what qualities does a perfect client have? In other words, which people do you enjoy spending time with?

- I like being around kind, humble, honest and intelligent people. I like being around people who are motivated by creating opportunities that have the potential to make a change.

- I like people who inspire others to improve themselves.

- I like working with people that I could see myself hiring onto my own team.

- I like people who respect others, nature and animals. I like people who make sacrifices for other humans and animals.

- I like people who show compassion and tolerance for other people and ideas.

- I like people who are learners. People who know that you have never stopped learning in life, and who understand that something valuable can be learned from (alomst) anyone.

- I like people who fight for themselves. I like people who make bold moves and brave decisions to create a better lifestyle for themselves.

- I like people who dare to be different and who don't let themselves be influenced by what the masses say.

- I like people who speak a clear language.

- I like people who challenge my own abilities and who make me grow by serving them.

- I like people who trust in me. I like people who know that I will get the job done, no matter what it takes.
